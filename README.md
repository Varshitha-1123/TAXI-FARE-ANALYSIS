# TAXI-FARE-ANALYSIS
Taxi fare analysis involves examining taxi ride data to understand pricing patterns, passenger behavior, demand trends, and operational efficiency. It's commonly used by city planners, ride-hailing companies, and data scientists. Here's a breakdown of key aspects:

---

### 📊 **Objectives of Taxi Fare Analysis**

* **Price Prediction**: Estimate the fare based on trip details.
* **Demand Forecasting**: Understand peak hours, busy zones, and passenger flow.
* **Anomaly Detection**: Spot outliers like overcharges or fraudulent fares.
* **Operational Efficiency**: Optimize routes and driver allocation.

---

### 🧾 **Common Data Fields**

Taxi fare datasets (like those from NYC Yellow Cabs or Kaggle) often include:

* `pickup_datetime`, `dropoff_datetime`
* `pickup_location`, `dropoff_location` (lat/lon or zones)
* `passenger_count`
* `trip_distance`
* `fare_amount`, `tip_amount`, `total_amount`
* `payment_type`

---

### 🔍 **Key Analyses**

* **Fare vs Distance**: Linear or nonlinear relationship.
* **Fare vs Time**: Impact of time of day, day of week, holidays.
* **Geospatial Analysis**: Map of hot pickup/dropoff zones.
* **Passenger Behavior**: Patterns by count, tips, or ride duration.

---

### 📦 **Tools and Libraries**

* **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `folium`, `scikit-learn`
* **SQL**: For querying large taxi fare datasets
* **GIS tools**: For spatial mapping

### 💡 Sample Use Case

**NYC Taxi Fare Prediction**: Predicting taxi fares using machine learning (linear regression, decision trees) on features like trip distance, passenger count, pickup/dropoff location, and time.
